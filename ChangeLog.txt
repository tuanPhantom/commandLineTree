Release v1.7 [01/03/2023]:
** Version name: "v1.7: Build Tree Async"
- Added a new "fast-enough" asynchronous method to build a Tree from a certain directory, which is also the default way from now on.

Release v1.6 [28/02/2023]:
** Version name: "v1.6: Build Tree Async"
- Added Asynchronous methods to build the Tree from a given directory, but these methods are currently disabled due to poor performance.
- Added performance measurement method.

Releases prior to v1.6 are not included in this changelog due to my laziness.
