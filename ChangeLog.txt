v1.7: Build Tree Async
Release date: 01/03/2023
Level: Minor update
- Added a new "fast-enough" asynchronous method to build a Tree from a certain directory, which is also the default way from now on.

v1.6: Build Tree Async
Release date: 28/02/2023
Level: Major update
- Added Asynchronous methods to build the Tree from a given directory, but these methods are currently disabled due to poor performance.
- Added performance measurement method.

Note
- Releases prior to v1.6 are not included in this changelog due to my laziness.
- The patches may not be listed since I need to find a girlfriend (lol).
